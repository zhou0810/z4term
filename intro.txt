Build a native Linux terminal emulator using Python, GTK4, and VTE with these features:

- Multiple terminal panes in a single window
- Split vertically (side by side) with Ctrl+Shift+D
- Split horizontally (top/bottom) with Ctrl+Shift+E
- Close current pane with Ctrl+Shift+W
- Navigate between panes with Ctrl+Tab
- Ctrl+C copies when text is selected, sends SIGINT when nothing is selected
- Ctrl+V pastes from clipboard
- Resizable panes using GTK Paned widgets
- Dark theme matching system theme
- New tab support with Ctrl+Shift+T
- Configurable font and font size
- Spawns /bin/bash (or user's default shell) per pane
- Clean minimal UI with no menu bar (or toggleable)
